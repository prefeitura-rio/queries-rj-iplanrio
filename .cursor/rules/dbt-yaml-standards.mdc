# dbt YAML Standards

## Model Configuration Block
Every model YAML file must include a description, followed by a configuration block with:

```yaml
models:
  - name: model_name
    description: my table description
    config:
      alias: model_name
      schema: layer_name  # raw, intermediate, or marts
      materialized: view  # for raw models
```

## Struct Field References
Nested structures (structs) must follow the dot notation pattern:

```yaml
# Correct
- name: struct.field
- name: struct.nested.field

# Incorrect ‚ùå
- name: field
  data_type: record
  columns:
    - name: subfield
```

### Examples:
1. Contact Information:
```yaml
- name: contato.telefone.ddd
- name: contato.telefone.numero
- name: contato.email
```

2. Address Fields:
```yaml
- name: endereco.cep
- name: endereco.logradouro
- name: endereco.numero
```

3. Nested Metadata:
```yaml
- name: metadata.source.system
- name: metadata.source.timestamp
```

## Required Field Attributes
Each field must include:
```yaml
- name: field_name
  description: "Clear description in Portuguese"
  data_type: string|integer|date|timestamp|boolean
  quote: true  # for string fields
```

## Testing Standards
All tests must have a name following [dbt-test-standards.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/dbt-test-standards.mdc)
1. Primary Keys:
```yaml
- name: id_field
  data_tests:
    - unique:
        name: model_name__id_field__unique
        severity: error
    - not_null:
        name: model_name__id_field__not_null
        severity: error
```

2. Foreign Keys:
```yaml
- name: id_related
  data_tests:
    - relationships:
        name: model_name__id_related__relationships
        to: ref('related_model')
        field: id_field
```

3. Data Quality:
```yaml
- name: field
  data_tests:
    - dbt_expectations.expect_column_values_to_match_regex:
        name: model_name__fied__expect_column_values_to_match_regex
        regex: '^pattern$'
        severity: warn
```

## File Organization
- One YAML file per model
- Place YAML files next to corresponding SQL files
- Follow naming convention: `model_name.yml`

## Documentation
All descriptions must be in Brazilian Portuguese and should include:
- Purpose of the field
- Business context
- Valid values or ranges
- Source system reference
